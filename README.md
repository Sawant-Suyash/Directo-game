# 🎯 Directo - A Memory Arrow Game

**Directo** is a simple, fun browser-based game inspired by the classic **Simon Says** game. Instead of colors and sounds, this game uses **arrow directions** (⬆️ ⬇️ ⬅️ ➡️). The game challenges the player's memory by generating an ever-growing sequence of arrow directions that must be repeated using keyboard arrow keys or on-screen buttons.

## 🕹️ How to Play

- Click **"Start"** to begin.
- A random arrow direction will flash in the center.
- Repeat the pattern using:
  - **Arrow keys** on your keyboard, or
  - Click the **on-screen arrow buttons**.
- The pattern will grow with each level. Your goal is to **remember and repeat the entire sequence** correctly.
